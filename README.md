# Machine-Learning-for-House-Prediction

<h1>Aim:</h1><br/>
Building a Knn regression model to forecast the price of house using the house data

<h1>Steps followed :</h1><br/>
1) Saved Price column in a separate vector<br/>
2) Normalized all the columns (except for boolean columns)<br/>
3) Built a function called knn.reg that implements a regression version of kNN that averages the prices of the k nearest neighbors.<br/>
4) Forecasted the price of new home using regression kNN using k = 4<br/>
